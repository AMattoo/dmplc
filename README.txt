INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the Model Checking for Distributed Algorithms code repository!

The MCDA project attempts to formally verify the correctness, safety or
other critical properties of distributed algorithm implementations, before
they are deployed. Our current approach involves sequentialization techniques
to analyze the structure of a program and its execution mechanics for each
participant in the networked application.

DIRECTORIES

  /sagar

  OK. Really, this directory should have a name that signifies what is in it,
  so finding information is intuitive.

  /simulation
  
  The simulation directory contains code to run VREP simulations of the area
  coverage.
  
  /meeting-notes
  
  Notes on overall strategy as discussed in meetings at SEI, CMU, and other
  locations
